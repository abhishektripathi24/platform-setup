## Overview
From the official docs -

> A graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. It is intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model. Instead, the data is stored like we first draw it out â€“ showing how each individual entity connects with or is related to others.
